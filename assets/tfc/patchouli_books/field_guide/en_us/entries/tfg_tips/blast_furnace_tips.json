This allows you to save $(item)Kaolinite$() and $(item)Graphite$() for $(thing)Casting Tables$()."

However, subsequent operations will take a similar amount of time despite the furnace being at temp already, as it needs to heat the metal from cold."

			"text": "If the metal is hot when added into the blast furnace, it will take less time to reach brilliant white. Consider heating your metal in a $(l:tfc:mechanics/charcoal_forge)Charcoal Forge$() before putting it into an already-hot furnace to save time, especially with smaller blast furnaces that process less at a time."

Pump into a $(l:tfc:tfcchannelcasting/channel_casting)Mold Table$() and extract the ingots with a hopper or chute: Easy automation!$(br2)You can automate the bellows with a $(item)Deployer$() too! Just be careful, as using the bellows excessively consumes more fuel and breaks your $(thing)tuyere$() faster.$(br2)You can process the resulting $(item)Pig Iron$() and $(item)High Carbon Steel$() in a $(thing)Forge Hammer$()."
